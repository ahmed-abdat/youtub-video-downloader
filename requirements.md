To develop a YouTube video downloader web application using Node.js with Express and Next.js 14 App Router, consider the following requirements:

**1. Development Environment:**
   - **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your system.
   - **Package Manager**: Use npm (bundled with Node.js) or yarn for managing dependencies.

**2. Backend Setup:**
   - **Express.js**: Facilitates handling API requests and routing.
   - **ytdl-core**: Enables downloading YouTube videos by extracting video information and streams.
   - **FFmpeg** (Optional): Assists in processing and converting video formats if needed.

**3. Frontend Setup:**
   - **Next.js 14**: Provides server-side rendering and routing capabilities.
   - **React**: For building interactive user interfaces.
   - **Tailwind CSS** (Optional): A utility-first CSS framework for styling.

**4. Project Structure:**
   - **Backend**:
     - Set up an Express server to handle API routes for video downloading.
     - Implement endpoints to process YouTube URLs and manage download requests.
   - **Frontend**:
     - Create pages and components in Next.js for user interaction.
     - Develop forms to accept YouTube URLs and display download options.

**5. Additional Considerations:**
   - **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for invalid URLs and download failures.
   - **User Feedback**: Provide progress indicators during the download process.
   - **Security**: Validate user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities.
   - **Compliance**: Ensure adherence to YouTube's terms of service and copyright laws.

**6. Deployment:**
   - **Hosting**: Choose a suitable platform (e.g., Vercel, Heroku) for deploying your application.
   - **Environment Variables**: Securely manage API keys and configuration settings.
